
// - Shallow Clone â†’ Copies only top-level properties (nested objects still reference the original).
// - Shallow cloning creates a new object or array that copies the top-level properties of the original, 
// but nested objects/arrays are still referenced (not deeply copied).

// Shallow Clone an Object with ... (Spread Operator)

// Syntax 
//    const clone = { ...original };
